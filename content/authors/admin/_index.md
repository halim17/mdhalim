I have been working as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Forestry and Environmental Science, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), Bangladesh. Currently I am on a sabbatical to pursue my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Sean C Thomas, Faculty of Forestry, University of Toronto, Canada. I have B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Forestry from the Department of Forestry and Environmental Science, SUST, Bangladesh.

I am currently studying different biogeophysical and biogeochemical aspects of fire and harvesting in the boreal forest. I am also interested in biochar as a means of climate change mitigation tool and soil amendment. My research broadly focuses on understanding how human activities (particularly forestry) affects our climate, and vice versa, in the tropics, temperate, and boreal regions. I am passionate about building low-cost instruments to study/monitor forest microclimate. I am nourished by open-source/-access resources, and a huge fan of these resources, and committed to contribute to their development.

At leisure, I enjoy watching movies, photographing landscapes, and playing football/badminton.
