I am a post-doctoral fellow (December 2019â€“ onward) at the University of Toronto. My current research examines the energy balance of green roofs and greenhouse gas fluxes from green roof substrates.

I received a Ph.D. in biometeorology from the University of Toronto in 2019, where I studied biogeophysical and biogeochemical aspects of post-fire and post-harvest boreal stands. My post-doctoral project is an excellent augmentation Ph.D. work that allows me to use similar tools and techniques to solve problems in a different ecosystem. I also study biochar as a climate change mitigation tool. My overarching research goal is to study biometeorological issues to help achieve "climate-smart" management in managed ecosystems spanning from tropical to boreal biomes. 

I received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Forestry from the Department of Forestry and Environmental Science, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), Bangladesh, where I also worked as an Assistant Professor from 2009--2013. My struggles with resources for teaching and research in Bangladesh has led me to use open-source teaching and learning materials extensively.  I am nourished by open-source resources and committed to contributing to their development. To make climate research more accessible in countries where it is needed the most, I have also co-founded a company ( [credoSense](https://credosense.com>) ) that builds cost-effective environmental sensor-logger systems.
