<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<p>I am a post-doctoral fellow (December 2019â€“ onward) at the University of Toronto. My current research examines the energy balance of green roofs and greenhouse gas fluxes from green roof substrates.</p> 

<p>I received a Ph.D. in biometeorology from the University of Toronto, where I studied some biogeophysical and biogeochemical aspects of post-fire and post-harvest boreal stands. Current post-doctoral project is an excellent augmentation of my Ph.D. work that allows me to use similar tools and techniques to solve problems in a different ecosystem. I also study biochar as a climate change mitigation tool. My overarching research goal is to study biometeorological issues to help achieve "climate-smart" management in managed ecosystems spanning from tropical to boreal biomes.</p> 

After receiving B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Forestry from the Department of Forestry and Environmental Science, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), Bangladesh, I worked as an Assistant Professor from 2009--2013 at the same university. My struggles with resources for teaching and research in Bangladesh has led me to use open-source teaching and learning materials extensively.  I am nourished by open-source resources and committed to contributing to their development. Additionally, to make climate research more accessible in countries where it is needed the most, I have co-founded a company <a href="https://credosense.com">CredoSense Inc.</a> that builds cost-effective environmental sensor-logger systems.</div>
