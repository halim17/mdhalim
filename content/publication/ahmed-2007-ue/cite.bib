 abstract = {Schumannianthus dichotoma (Murta) is widely grown in wetland
areas of Bangladesh, providing the raw material for prayer and
bed mats and also minimizing flood risk and soil erosion. The
study was carried out in two villages in Gowainghat Thana
(subdistrict) in Sylhet district, to determine techniques for
traditional management of Murta plantations and its role in the
household economy. On average, about 13% of the total homestead
area is used for Murta plantations. Propagation was from
rhizomes and branch cuttings, and little intensive management
was required. Harvesting was usually done annually, from
mid-September to the end of March. Three-quarters of respondents
were directly involved in Murta-based cottage enterprises,
providing an average annual income of US$216: 43% of total
income. Net average profit per man-day from selling articles
varies from US$0.23 to 0.73. Middlemen make significant profits,
due to lack of marketing knowledge and available market
information and marketing facilities of the villagers. The
cultivation and processing of Murta has great potential for the
rural economy of such areas.},
