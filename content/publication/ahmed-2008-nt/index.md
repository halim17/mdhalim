abstract: The state of urban seedling nurseries in the north-eastern region of Bangladesh
  is examined with a focus on production and profitability of the enterprises. Twenty-eight
  sample nurseries out of the 97 nursery enterprises in Sylhet town were selected
  at random, and operators personally interviewed. It was found that the entrepreneurs
  are not highly educated though they believed that a basic level of education is
  required to understand the management of young nursery stock. Labourers of various
  employment categories work in the enterprises and their wage is determined by their
  skill, gender and efficiency. Capital and operating costs vary among the enterprises
  according to land value, production capacity, infrastructure type and workforce
  size. Production capacity ranges from 10,000 to 5 M seedlings/year with an average
  836,000, though actual average production is only 341,000 seedlings/year. The production
  cost per seedling ranges from Tk. 4 to 50 while sale value ranges from Tk. 10 to
  60. The most frequently sold species are Acacia mangium, Swietenia macrophylla,
  Tectona grandis, Mangifera indica, Litchi chinensis and Cocos nucifera. Nursery
  techniques and cultural practices adopted by nursery operators depend on the type
  of species and its silvicultural requirement. Despite some problems, including lack
  of suitable land for nursery establishment and inadequate level of technical knowledge
  for high quality seedling management, it seems that production of tree seedlings
  is a promising profitable small-scale business in the study area.
