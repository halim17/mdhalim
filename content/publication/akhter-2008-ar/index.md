abstract: This review describes the non-timber forest products (NTFPs) used for different
  aspects of beauty-care in Bangladesh on the basis of extensive literature survey.
  The diverse plant species, including used parts and using patterns for hair care,
  facial treatments and body care, were summarized in 13 tables. This paper accumulate
  the scattered knowledge regarding the use of plants in beauty-care in Bangladesh,
  to draw the extent of use of NTFPs in health care and to record the knowledge for
  assessing the possibilities of further implementation in herbal cosmetics industries.
  The structured knowledge can be used in policy making process for sustainable management
  of these valuable NTFPs leading to the conservation of the country's biological
  diversity. It is suggested that intensive field level research is necessary for
  securing sustainability of NTFPs.
