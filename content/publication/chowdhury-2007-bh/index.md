abstract: An exploratory study was conducted on the hunting and gathering of wildlife
  by the Mro tribe in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs) of Bangladesh, highlighting
  the target animals, preference, frequency and various indigenous techniques of hunting.
  The farmers are primarily dependent on shifting cultivation and hunting is a secondary
  occupation, particularly important for poor people. Though the tribe rears some
  domestic animals for sacrificing on special occasions, game meat appears to be a
  highly welcomed dietary supplement. A total of 34 species of wildlife were harvested
  from forests, from insect larvae to elephants. Wild boar ranked first for rich and
  medium farmers, and monitor lizards were ranked second by all the farmers. The indigenous
  knowledge about their living patterns and animals has potential for use in commercial
  animal farming to fulfil the protein demand and improve the socio-economic condition
  of the Mro.
