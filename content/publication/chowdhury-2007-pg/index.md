abstract: The physical properties of soil on two hill slopes of 35% and 55% in orange
  orchard cultivated by the Mro tribe of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs) were evaluated
  and compared with those of bushy hill forests. Soil samples were collected from
  three different depths (0--5 cm, 5--15 cm and 15--30 cm), digging three profiles
  in each land use for determining moisture content, organic matter content and particle
  density. Maximum water holding capacity, field capacity, dry and moist bulk density
  and porosity were determined only for the surface soils. Moisture content at all
  the soil depths was significantly higher (p $Å‚eq$ 0.05) in orange orchard than in
  forest on both the slopes. Orange orchard contained lower mean soil organic matter
  than forest on 55% slope, while it contained higher values on 35% slope compared
  to forest. The highest value of the above two properties was found at surface soil
  in both the land uses on both the slopes, decreasing with the increase of soil depth.
  On both the slopes maximum water holding capacity and porosity of surface soil and
  particle density at all soil depths were lower in orange orchard compared to those
  in forest. Field capacity values of surface soil did not show consistency in trend
  for the differences between the two land uses on both the slopes. Bulk density value
  of moist and dry surface soil was higher in orange orchard than in forest on both
  the hill slopes.
