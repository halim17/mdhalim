abstract: This study considered traditional ethno-medicinal practices of rural people
  of Feni district, Bangladesh, focusing on their utilization of medicinal plants
  and associated indigenous knowledge. Ninety households were interviewed using a
  semi-structured questionnaire. Plant resources are used to treat 26 different ailments
  ranging from simple cuts to diabetes. In total, 46 medicinal plants are as used,
  of which a third are trees. Homesteads are the primary source and few medicinal
  plants are cultivated. Aboveground plant parts are most used, particularly leaves.
  The diverse patterns of use of different medicinal plant parts shows the considerable
  indigenous knowledge of rural people and is generally widely available.
