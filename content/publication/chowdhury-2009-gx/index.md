abstract: The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs) region of Bangladesh, covering a considerable
  portion of hill forest type of the country, is rich in biological diversity; in
  terms of flora, fauna and ethnicity. A number of aboriginal and tribal communities
  enrich the cultural heritage of the region. Thanchi upazilla (sub-district) of Bandarban
  district in the CHTs is the remotest forested area where some tribal groups still
  lead their subsistence life depending fully on natural resources. This exploratory
  study was conducted to document indigenous knowledge (IK) employed by the Mro tribe
  in their everyday activities, highlighting traditional utilization of forests and
  other natural resources. A total of 36 farms were assessed using different participatory
  appraisals through semi-structured questionnaire. The respondents were peasants
  who live on the hilltops in a pristine environment, inside the high ranges of hills
  and dense forest almost totally beyond the eye-sight of the outer civilized society.
  They developed IK of their own in practising shifting cultivation (Jhum) and other
  land use systems along with the utilization of natural resources. In most cases,
  such IK has become key factors in the sound management of their forest resources
  with sustainable utilization of biodiversity. But most of the wealth of their IK
  is being threatened by the settlement of the non-tribal people in the CHTs region.
  The life style and ethno-forestry perception regulated by IK governing the daily
  activities of the ethnic communities need to be explored in order to conserve them
  and to assess the possibilities for conserving the forest resources by utilizing
  such traditional indigenous concepts.
