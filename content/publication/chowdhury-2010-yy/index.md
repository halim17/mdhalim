abstract: Throughout the world ornamentation of body with mehedi (Lawsonia inermis
  L.) leaf paste, with the trade name `henna body art' is becoming increasingly popular.
  The worldwide increasing demand of mehedi leaf encourages many countries to adopt
  commercial farming of the plant. Farmers living in central Bangladesh recently commenced
  small-scale mehedi farming, primarily with the purpose of meeting national demand.
  A total of 182 farmers are engaged in mehedi farming and a study was conducted among
  36 of them (a 20% random sample) to explore indigenous management techniques, marketing,
  livelihood potential and constraints of the enterprise. Farming was reported to
  be the major primary occupation of the study area. An average of 0.05 ha land of
  the respondents was used for mehedi cultivation, which constituted 16.7% of their
  average farm land. The farmers applied their own indigenous technology in every
  aspect of the farming, using branch cuttings as the only propagation material. The
  financial analysis indicated that mehedi farming is a profitable and attractive
  option for rural livelihoods [with an estimated net present value of Tk (Bangladeshi
  currency unit, 1 US $ = 68 Taka (as of May, 2009).) 179,500 for 0.1 ha plantation].
  However, the enterprise faces several constraints, including absence of a nursery
  for supplying planting materials, storage and effective marketing facilities, available
  capital for investment, improved technology, and above all, government support.
  If the government extends cooperation by assisting farmers with training, technology,
  credit and market development, mehedi farming could become an important revenue-earning
  enterprise in the small-scale cottage sector of Bangladesh.
