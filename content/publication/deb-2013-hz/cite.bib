 abstract = {Both for environmental and aesthetic purposes, urban street
trees have significant importance. In most of the developed
cities, this type of plantation is an integral part of landscape
planning. Nevertheless, this issue is poorly considered in the
cities of developing countries. Consequently, we observe a
scarcity of urban street trees. Considering this scenario, we
explored the state of urban street tree planting in Sylhet City,
which is a growing urban centre in Bangladesh. We assessed the
density, diversity, composition and distribution of street trees
in the city using different diversity computation indices (e.g.
relative abundances, dominance, importance and richness,
evenness and diversity) in main and link roads. We also measured
the growth pattern of the trees in the study area. It was found
that out of 486 studied transects in both main and link roads,
404 had no trees. Sweitenia mahagoni was the dominant species in
both road categories. The Mann Whitney U test results suggest
that there was no significant difference in tree density and
size attributes between the road categories. From these
assessments, we concluded that the diversity and distribution of
street trees in the study area was very limited. Moreover, there
was no scientific arboricultural consideration in species
selection to increase street tree planting for the city. We
conclude that only proper management and objective-specific
endeavor can change the prevailing scenario of the study area.},
