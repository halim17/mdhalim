abstract: Both for environmental and aesthetic purposes, urban street trees have significant
  importance. In most of the developed cities, this type of plantation is an integral
  part of landscape planning. Nevertheless, this issue is poorly considered in the
  cities of developing countries. Consequently, we observe a scarcity of urban street
  trees. Considering this scenario, we explored the state of urban street tree planting
  in Sylhet City, which is a growing urban centre in Bangladesh. We assessed the density,
  diversity, composition and distribution of street trees in the city using different
  diversity computation indices (e.g. relative abundances, dominance, importance and
  richness, evenness and diversity) in main and link roads. We also measured the growth
  pattern of the trees in the study area. It was found that out of 486 studied transects
  in both main and link roads, 404 had no trees. Sweitenia mahagoni was the dominant
  species in both road categories. The Mann Whitney U test results suggest that there
  was no significant difference in tree density and size attributes between the road
  categories. From these assessments, we concluded that the diversity and distribution
  of street trees in the study area was very limited. Moreover, there was no scientific
  arboricultural consideration in species selection to increase street tree planting
  for the city. We conclude that only proper management and objective-specific endeavor
  can change the prevailing scenario of the study area.
