 abstract = {For many years foresters have been using statistical probability
density functions to describe and characterise stand structure.
Predicting the current and future yields of a stand is essential
for successful stand and timber management. Implicit prediction
of current yield is accomplished by using diameter distribution
methods. All diameter distribution yield systems predict the
number of trees per unit area by diameter class. In this study,
the normal, lognormal and the three-parameter Weibull
probability density function were compared to characterise the
diameter distributions of Sal (Shorea robusta) plantations grown
at Tilagarh Eco-park, Bangladesh. Data from 70 plots,
established in three plantations, were used for this study. The
Weibull parameters were estimated by the maximum likelihood and
moments estimator methods. A one-sample Kolmogorov Smirnov test
was used for the goodness of fit for all models. The
Kolmogorov?Smirnov test results showed that both lognormal and
Weibull distributions were suitable to characterise the diameter
distributions of Sal plantations in the study area and may be
applicable for other Sal forests in Bangladesh.},
