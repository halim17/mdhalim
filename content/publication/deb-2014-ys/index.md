abstract: For many years foresters have been using statistical probability density
  functions to describe and characterise stand structure. Predicting the current and
  future yields of a stand is essential for successful stand and timber management.
  Implicit prediction of current yield is accomplished by using diameter distribution
  methods. All diameter distribution yield systems predict the number of trees per
  unit area by diameter class. In this study, the normal, lognormal and the three-parameter
  Weibull probability density function were compared to characterise the diameter
  distributions of Sal (Shorea robusta) plantations grown at Tilagarh Eco-park, Bangladesh.
  Data from 70 plots, established in three plantations, were used for this study.
  The Weibull parameters were estimated by the maximum likelihood and moments estimator
  methods. A one-sample Kolmogorov Smirnov test was used for the goodness of fit for
  all models. The Kolmogorov?Smirnov test results showed that both lognormal and Weibull
  distributions were suitable to characterise the diameter distributions of Sal plantations
  in the study area and may be applicable for other Sal forests in Bangladesh.
