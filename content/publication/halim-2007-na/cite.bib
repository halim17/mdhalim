 abstract = {The Shaiji, a religio-cultural community of southwestern
Bangladesh, have an indigenous medication system using locally
grown plants. A total of 36 individuals were interviewed using
questionnaire. The Shaiji, living in the interior or near bushy
habitats for the sake of meditation and other spiritual
activities, were found to be totally dependent on herbal
medicines for treating ailments ranging from casual cold to
diabetes. As this indigenous knowledge is handed down orally
from generation to generation, there is a great possibility that
the knowledge will be lost over time. A total of 47 plant
species were used by the Shaiji for medicinal purposes. They
mainly used leaves, either taken orally or used externally. They
used the plant species in a sustainable manner and also
cultivated some. Thus, they play an important role in
biodiversity conservation.},
