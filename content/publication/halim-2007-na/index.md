abstract: The Shaiji, a religio-cultural community of southwestern Bangladesh, have
  an indigenous medication system using locally grown plants. A total of 36 individuals
  were interviewed using questionnaire. The Shaiji, living in the interior or near
  bushy habitats for the sake of meditation and other spiritual activities, were found
  to be totally dependent on herbal medicines for treating ailments ranging from casual
  cold to diabetes. As this indigenous knowledge is handed down orally from generation
  to generation, there is a great possibility that the knowledge will be lost over
  time. A total of 47 plant species were used by the Shaiji for medicinal purposes.
  They mainly used leaves, either taken orally or used externally. They used the plant
  species in a sustainable manner and also cultivated some. Thus, they play an important
  role in biodiversity conservation.
