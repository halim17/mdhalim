abstract: An exploratory study was conducted in Chuadanga, a southwestern district
  of Bangladesh to explore the status and potential of Khejur palm (Phoenix sylvestris
  Roxb.) husbandry in the rural economy. A total of 36 households in three villages
  of the district were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. The farmers
  were categorized into five groups as landless, marginal, small, medium and large
  on the basis of their land holdings. The palm was distributed over seven different
  geographical sites of which orchards supported the most (20%). The farmers of medium
  category owned the most palms (33%) and the landless the fewest (4%), but most of
  the palms (29%) were managed by the landless category. Palms 7?14 years old growing
  in the agricultural fields and ails produced most sap (2500ml, on average each night).
  The large category farmers realized the highest average seasonal income from the
  palm products (Taka1 38,135.00), but the relative contribution to income from palm
  products was the highest (78%) among the landless farmers. Khejur palm husbandry
  could be a promising source of rural incomes in Bangladesh if the farmers' indigenous
  technology was linked to more scientific management practices.
