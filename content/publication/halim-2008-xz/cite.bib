 abstract = {A study was conducted to investigate the land-use pattern change
over a period of 18 years (1988--2006) by using remote sensing
and Geographical Information System (GIS) technologies, in the
West Bhanugach Reserved Forest, a hill forest, in Sylhet Forest
Division of Bangladesh. The images were processed using ERDAS
Imagine software. Both supervised and unsupervised approaches
were applied and ground control points were collected using a
GPS. Maps were prepared using GIS software. Results showed that
vegetation cover drastically decreased from the year 1988 to 1996
(1 826 ha to 1 714.85 ha), but increased gradually from the year
1996 to 2006 (1 714.85 ha to 1 847.83 ha) due to the initiation
of co-management practice involving local communities. Change in
bare land was inversely proportionate to the amount of vegetation
cover changes unless any other land-uses were converted into bare
land. The area of water bodies increased from the year 1988 to
1996 (307.67 ha to 379.53 ha), but decreased from the year 1996
to 1997, then remained invariabile from the year 1997 to 2006.
Some recommendations were also made for applying the RS and GIS
techniques to study the land-use pattern change in the Bhanugach
Reserved Forest and to create a GIS data base for the study area.},
