abstract: A study was conducted to investigate the land-use pattern change over a
  period of 18 years (1988--2006) by using remote sensing and Geographical Information
  System (GIS) technologies, in the West Bhanugach Reserved Forest, a hill forest,
  in Sylhet Forest Division of Bangladesh. The images were processed using ERDAS Imagine
  software. Both supervised and unsupervised approaches were applied and ground control
  points were collected using a GPS. Maps were prepared using GIS software. Results
  showed that vegetation cover drastically decreased from the year 1988 to 1996 (1
  826 ha to 1 714.85 ha), but increased gradually from the year 1996 to 2006 (1 714.85
  ha to 1 847.83 ha) due to the initiation of co-management practice involving local
  communities. Change in bare land was inversely proportionate to the amount of vegetation
  cover changes unless any other land-uses were converted into bare land. The area
  of water bodies increased from the year 1988 to 1996 (307.67 ha to 379.53 ha), but
  decreased from the year 1996 to 1997, then remained invariabile from the year 1997
  to 2006. Some recommendations were also made for applying the RS and GIS techniques
  to study the land-use pattern change in the Bhanugach Reserved Forest and to create
  a GIS data base for the study area.
