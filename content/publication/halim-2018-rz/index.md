abstract: Scientists unequivocally agree that winter air temperature (TA) in northern
  high latitudes will increase sharply with anthropogenic climate change, and that
  such increases are already pervasive. However, contrasting hypotheses and results
  exist regarding the magnitude and even direction of changes in winter soil temperature
  (TS). Here we use field and satellite data to examine the 'cold soil in a warm world'
  hypothesis for the first time in the boreal forest using a proxy year approach.
  In a proxy warm year with a mean annual temperature similar to that predicted for
  ~2080, average winter TS was reduced relative to the baseline year by 0.43 to 1.22
  Â°C in open to forested sites. Similarly, average minimum and maximum winter TS declined,
  and the number of freeze-thaw events increased in the proxy warm year, corresponding
  to a reduction in the number of snow-covered days relative to the baseline year.
  Our findings indicate that early soil freezing as a result of delayed snowfall and
  reduced snow insulation from cold winter air are the main drivers of reduced winter
  active-layer TS (at ~2-cm depth) under warming conditions in boreal forest, and
  we also show that these drivers interact strongly with forest stand structure.
