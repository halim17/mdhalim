abstract: Surface albedo is one of the most important processes governing climate
  forcing in the boreal forest and is directly affected by management activities such
  as harvesting and natural disturbances such as forest fires. Empirical data on the
  effects of these disturbances on boreal forest albedo are sparse. We conducted ground-based
  measurements of surface albedo from a series of instrument towers over 4 years in
  a replicated chronosequence of mixed-wood boreal forest sites differing in stand
  age (0 to 19 years since disturbance) in both post-harvest and post-fire stands.
  We investigated the effects of stand age, canopy height, tree species composition,
  and ground vegetation cover on surface albedo through stand development. Our results
  indicate that winter and spring albedo values were 63 % and 24 % higher, respectively,
  in post-harvest stands than in post-fire stands.Summer and fall albedo values were
  similar between disturbance types, with summer albedo showing a transient peak atâˆ¼10
  years stand age. The proportion of deciduous broadleaf species showed a strong positive
  relationship with seasonal averages of albedo in both post-harvest and post-fire
  stands.Given that stand composition in mixedwood boreal forests generally shows
  a gradual replacement of deciduous trees by conifers, our results suggest that successional
  changes in species composition are likely a key driver of age-related patterns in
  albedo. Our findings also suggest the efficacy of increasing the proportion of deciduous
  broadleaf species as a silvicultural option for climate-friendly management of the
  boreal forest.
