abstract: One of humanity's most significant challenges in the process of attaining
  the established sustainability goals is balancing the growing human demand for food
  and the need to conserve biodiversity. This challenge requires appropriate land
  uses that are able to conserve biodiversity while ensuring ample food supply. This
  study compares bird species diversity and abundance in areas undergoing land sharing
  and land sparing in northeastern Bangladesh (West Bhanugach Reserved Forest). Birds
  serve as useful biologic indicators because of their presence within different trophic
  levels and their well-studied ecology. To survey birds, we selected a total of 66
  sampling sites within land-sharing (33) and land-sparing (33) land-use areas. Between
  May and June 2017, we observed and recorded bird calls within a 50-m radius around
  each sampling site. We counted 541 individuals from 46 species of birds. The Shannon
  bird diversity was higher in the land-sparing sites (1.52) than in the land-sharing
  sites (1.23). We found approximately 30% more bird species (39 vs. 30) and 40% more
  individuals (318 vs. 223) in the land-sparing areas than land-sharing areas. Three
  bird species, Arachnothera longirostra, Micropternus brachyurus and Copsychus malabaricus,
  were significantly associated with the land-sparing sites. This study shows that
  land sharing negatively affects bird diversity, richness and abundance compared
  to land-sparing. The use of chemical fertilizers and the lack of food, such as insects,
  for birds can explain the lower diversity, richness and abundance of birds in the
  land-sharing areas. Although land sharing is an effective means of producing food,
  land sparing is the most effective land-use practice for preserving bird diversity
  in northeastern Bangladesh.
