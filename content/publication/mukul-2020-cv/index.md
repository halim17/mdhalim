abstract: "Forests cover about thirty percent of the Earth's land surface and are\
  \ important in providing critical ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration,\
  \ storage, and cycling. Forests sequester and store more carbon than any other terrestrial\
  \ ecosystem on Earth. In forests, plants take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\
  \ and release oxygen during photosynthesis, which transfers carbon to their stems,\
  \ roots, and leaves as they grow. Forests store carbon in five major pools, these\
  \ are: i) aboveground biomass, ii) belowground biomass, iii) litter, iv) deadwood\
  \ and v) soil. Forests are also a major source of global anthropogenic carbon emissions,\
  \ the second largest after fossil fuel. Protecting forests from deforestation and\
  \ degradation and expansion of forest in new areas is, therefore, considered as\
  \ amongst the most cost-effective strategy for climate change mitigation. Here,\
  \ we provide a synthesis of current knowledge regarding forest carbon stock and\
  \ fluxes, their distribution across different biomes, biogeochemical cycles, their\
  \ measurement and drivers of change in global forest carbon stock and fluxes. Finally,\
  \ we provide recommendations on strategies for improving forest carbon stocks to\
  \ achieve sustainable development goals, biodiversity conservation, and future climate\
  \ stabilization."
