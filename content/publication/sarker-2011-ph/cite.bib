 abstract = {Imposing logging ban has become widespread in the tropics.
Bangladesh government enforced logging bans in 1970s and 1980s to
halt deforestation. Such bans have been considered as a strategy
to protect and conserve forests although success requires
rigorous analysis. In this paper, the performances of the
existing logging bans in Bangladesh are examined to assess their
effectiveness. Responses of forest management systems, policies,
production and governance in attaining the objectives of logging
bans are thoroughly addressed and investigated. From this study
it is evident that unwise implementations of logging bans have
failed to secure forest conservation and production related
objectives of the government. Based on the findings, five future
directives are advised: (I) continuation of bans in critical
natural forests, (II) reinitiating of management practices in the
plantations, (III) introducing multipurpose forestry in the
protected area co-management systems, (IV) adoption of adaptive
community based forest management, and (V) ensure good forest
governance.},
