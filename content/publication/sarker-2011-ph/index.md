abstract: 'Imposing logging ban has become widespread in the tropics. Bangladesh government
  enforced logging bans in 1970s and 1980s to halt deforestation. Such bans have been
  considered as a strategy to protect and conserve forests although success requires
  rigorous analysis. In this paper, the performances of the existing logging bans
  in Bangladesh are examined to assess their effectiveness. Responses of forest management
  systems, policies, production and governance in attaining the objectives of logging
  bans are thoroughly addressed and investigated. From this study it is evident that
  unwise implementations of logging bans have failed to secure forest conservation
  and production related objectives of the government. Based on the findings, five
  future directives are advised: (I) continuation of bans in critical natural forests,
  (II) reinitiating of management practices in the plantations, (III) introducing
  multipurpose forestry in the protected area co-management systems, (IV) adoption
  of adaptive community based forest management, and (V) ensure good forest governance.'
