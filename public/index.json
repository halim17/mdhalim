Dive into the heart of my work, where I harness the power of deep learning and open-source satellite imagery to map methane emissions with high accuracy in bustling urban areas. Given that cities are both the major contributors to and frontline victims of climate change, my research is crucial in crafting climate-resilient urban planning strategies.\nMy academic journey reached a significant milestone in 2020 when I was awarded a Ph.D. in Biometeorology from the University of Toronto. During this period, I delved into the intricate biogeophysical and biogeochemical dynamics of boreal mixedwood forests, focusing on their recovery post-fire and post-harvest. This exploration laid the groundwork for my current post-doctoral project, which beautifully extends my Ph.D. research to urban ecosystems. Utilizing a blend of remote sensing, GIS, biometeorological and ecophysiological tools, and machine learning, I seek to address the urgent need for \"climate-smart\" management across diverse ecosystems worldwide.\nBefore embarking on this academic voyage, I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Forestry from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Bangladesh. Following my studies, I dedicated myself to academia as a faculty member at the same university from 2009 to 2023. My journey was marked by a commitment to overcoming resource limitations through the adoption of open-source teaching and learning materials. This experience not only enriched my educational approach but also inspired me to contribute actively to the open-source community.\nDriven by a desire to democratize climate research, I co-founded CredoSense Inc., a venture aimed at developing affordable environmental sensor-logger systems. This initiative is a testament to my commitment to making climate solutions more accessible, especially in regions where they are most needed.\nExplore my work and join me in the quest for sustainable, climate-smart solutions that protect our urban and forest ecosystems for generations to come.\nDownload my latest CV.\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/author/md-abdul-halim/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/md-abdul-halim/","section":"authors","summary":"Welcome to my biography!

'Sustainable biochars' derived from locally produced waste biomass and produced  near the application site are of particular interest. We tested the effects of surface applications of wood-derived biochars (applied at 7.5 t·ha−1) on soil physiochemical properties (N, P, K, pH, soil moisture content, organic matter content, and bulk density) in three land-use types: agriculture (Camellia sinensis monoculture), agroforestry (C. sinensis} with shade trees), and secondary forest (Dipterocarpus dominated) assessed over seven months. We found significant positive effects of biochar on soil physiochemical properties in all land-use types, with the strongest responses in the most degraded tea monoculture sites. Although biochar had no significant effect on soil N and K, it improved soil P--the primary nutrient most commonly limiting in tropical soils. Biochar also enhanced soil moisture and organic matter content, reduced bulk density, and increased soil pH in monoculture sites. Our results support the general hypothesis that biochar can improve the fertility of degraded soils in agricultural and forest systems in Bangladesh and suggest that biochar additions may be of great benefit to the most degraded soils.","tags":[],"title":"Biochar effects on soil physiochemical properties in degraded managed ecosystems in northeastern Bangladesh","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akib Hasan","Miguel Montoro Girona","Guillaume Grosbois","Narayan Saha","Md Abdul Halim"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368140,"objectID":"77b36c2be7acfd8505d678d4e36ca685","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/hasan-2020-jt/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:00.407545Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hasan-2020-jt/","section":"publication","summary":"One of humanity's most significant challenges in the process of attaining the established sustainability goals is balancing the growing human demand for food and the need to conserve biodiversity. This challenge requires appropriate land uses that are able to conserve biodiversity while ensuring ample food supply. This study compares bird species diversity and abundance in areas undergoing land sharing and land sparing in northeastern Bangladesh (West Bhanugach Reserved Forest). Birds serve as useful biologic indicators because of their presence within different trophic levels and their well-studied ecology. To survey birds, we selected a total of 66 sampling sites within land-sharing (33) and land-sparing (33) land-use areas. Between May and June 2017, we observed and recorded bird calls within a 50-m radius around each sampling site. We counted 541 individuals from 46 species of birds. The Shannon bird diversity was higher in the land-sparing sites (1.52) than in the land-sharing sites (1.23). We found approximately 30% more bird species (39 vs. 30) and 40% more individuals (318 vs. 223) in the land-sparing areas than land-sharing areas. Three bird species, Arachnothera longirostra, Micropternus brachyurus and Copsychus malabaricus, were significantly associated with the land-sparing sites. This study shows that land sharing negatively affects bird diversity, richness and abundance compared to land-sparing. The use of chemical fertilizers and the lack of food, such as insects, for birds can explain the lower diversity, richness and abundance of birds in the land-sharing areas. Although land sharing is an effective means of producing food, land sparing is the most effective land-use practice for preserving bird diversity in northeastern Bangladesh.","tags":[],"title":"Land sparing can maintain bird diversity in northeastern Bangladesh","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sharif A Mukul","Md Abdul Halim","John Herbohn"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368141,"objectID":"42891ee672f894cff96e4e70e4ab8de4","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/mukul-2020-cv/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:00.745416Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mukul-2020-cv/","section":"publication","summary":"Forests cover about thirty percent of the Earth's land surface and are important in providing critical ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, storage, and cycling. Forests sequester and store more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. In forests, plants take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen during photosynthesis, which transfers carbon to their stems, roots, and leaves as they grow. Forests store carbon in five major pools, these are: i) aboveground biomass, ii) belowground biomass, iii) litter, iv) deadwood and v) soil. Forests are also a major source of global anthropogenic carbon emissions, the second largest after fossil fuel. Protecting forests from deforestation and degradation and expansion of forest in new areas is, therefore, considered as amongst the most cost-effective strategy for climate change mitigation. Here, we provide a synthesis of current knowledge regarding forest carbon stock and fluxes, their distribution across different biomes, biogeochemical cycles, their measurement and drivers of change in global forest carbon stock and fluxes. Finally, we provide recommendations on strategies for improving forest carbon stocks to achieve sustainable development goals, biodiversity conservation, and future climate stabilization.","tags":[],"title":"Forest carbon stock and fluxes: Distribution, biogeochemical cycles, and measurement techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Md Abdul Halim","Juliana Vantellingen","Adam Gorgolewski","William Rose","Melanie Sifton","Jennifer Drake","Liat Margolis","Sean C Thomas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368140,"objectID":"250bb86e4f13b0b4bf85b75fe056b2ac","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/halim-2020-pd/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:08:59.77439Z","relpermalink":"/publication/halim-2020-pd/","section":"publication","summary":"Green roofs are an emerging approach to enhance climate resilience of urban areas, including mitigation of stormwater discharge and urban heat island effects. There has also been recent interest in green roofs to enhance carbon sequestration, but direct measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes from established green roof systems are lacking. To better understand the relationships between green roof vegetation and substrate with greenhouse gas fluxes, we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes, using a dynamic closed chamber technique, from substrates of experimental green roof units in Toronto in the early, mid, and late growing seasons of 2018. This measurements included extensive systems with mixes of Sedum species and intensive systems using a native meadow species mix, with both vegetation types implemented in a factorial design with substrate depth and type (high vs. low organic matter content) as factors. We hypothesized that CO2 fluxes would be higher in high organic matter substrates, and that systems with low vegetation cover and high organic matter would act as CH4 sources. Substrate CO2 efflux varied from 0.1--0.51 µmol.m-2.s-1, with pronounced differences in flux rates related to substrate type and depth (higher with increased substrate depth) but had little effect of vegetation type. Substrate CH4 fuxes included both net efflux and uptake (-0.1 to 0.14 nmol.m-2.s-1). Net uptake was found to be associated with high vegetation cover, particularly of native species. Results suggest that high organic matter in green roof substrates, while enhancing plant growth, can result in appreciable C losses, partly as CH4. Studies have explored various green roof substrates to enhance carbon sequestration of green roofs. Biochar, usually derived from pyrolyzed waste biomass, can be a potential amendment to green roof substrates to mitigate C loss. Recalcitrant biochars can increase soil water holding capacity and plant growth, and also known to suppress soil greenhouse gas fluxes in managed systems. However, the biochar effects on greenhouse fluxes of greenroof substrates have not previously been evaluated. In a similar experimental setup as above, we examined the effects of biochar addition (20 t/ha, sugar maple biochar) to a high organic matter green roof substrate in Sedum beds. Initial results indicate that biochar addition does not affect substrate CO2 effluxes, but can significantly reduce carbon loss from green roofs, mainly by suppressing (200%) CH4 effluuxes. Overall, our studies suggest that biochar can be a sustainable amendment to green roof substrates to mitigate C loss.","tags":[],"title":"Greenhouse gas fluxes from green roof substrates and biochar as a mitigation tool","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S C Thomas","M A Halim","N Gale","L Sujeeun"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368141,"objectID":"1b5f7a4a441599475000dcc1c2936c25","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/thomas-2019-xt/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:01.05284Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thomas-2019-xt/","section":"publication","summary":"Biochar, or pyrolyzed organic matter intended for use as a soil amendment, has a variety of properties of interest from the perspective of agroforestry, in particular its potential to increase soil C sequestration and enhance yields by increased retention of soil mineral nutrients. Nitrogen-fixing legumes commonly show large growth responses to biochar, and we hypothesized that combinations of legumes and non-legumes would show increased enhancement of yields in mixture due to enhanced facilitation related to increased nutrient retention. This hypothesis was tested in a glasshouse pot trial involving the leguminous tree leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala), and maize (Zea mays) grown for 120 days in mixture and monoculture in both an unamended soil and soil amended with a slow-pyrolysis coconut husk biochar at 10 t/ha. Responses were quantified in terms of biomass production and partitioning, leaf-level gas-exchange, leaf chlorophyll content, and (for leucaena) root nodule formation. Consistent with predictions, leucaena showed more pronounced growth and physiological responses to biochar than did maize. The system also showed increased total biomass yields relative to monocultures in the two-species mixtures with biochar (relative yield in mixture [RYM] = 1.69; 95% CI 1.41-1.81), but not in the control treatment (RYM = 1.25; 95% CI 0.93-1.76), and positive effects of biochar on yield were generally greater for both species when grown in mixture. Growth responses to biochar were most pronounced for stem and root biomass, and growth responses were consistent with changes in leaf-level photosynthesis and chlorophyll content. In addition, biochar had large effects on biomass partitioning, enhancing stem allocation in both species. Our results suggest that biochar additions may augment facilitative interactions in agroforestry and intercropped systems on acidic, nutrient-deficient soils by enhancing system nutrient retention.","tags":["\"Biochar; Intercropping; Legumes; Leucaena; Maize; Relative yield\""],"title":"Biochar enhancement of facilitation effects in agroforestry: early growth and physiological responses in a maize-leucaena model system","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Empirical data on the effects of these disturbances on boreal forest albedo are sparse. We conducted ground-based measurements of surface albedo from a series of instrument towers over 4 years in a replicated chronosequence of mixed-wood boreal forest sites differing in stand age (0 to 19 years since disturbance) in both post-harvest and post-fire stands. We investigated the effects of stand age, canopy height, tree species composition, and ground vegetation cover on surface albedo through stand development. Our results indicate that winter and spring albedo values were 63 % and 24 % higher, respectively, in post-harvest stands than in post-fire stands.Summer and fall albedo values were similar between disturbance types, with summer albedo showing a transient peak at∼10 years stand age. The proportion of deciduous broadleaf species showed a strong positive relationship with seasonal averages of albedo in both post-harvest and post-fire stands.Given that stand composition in mixedwood boreal forests generally shows a gradual replacement of deciduous trees by conifers, our results suggest that successional changes in species composition are likely a key driver of age-related patterns in albedo. Our findings also suggest the efficacy of increasing the proportion of deciduous broadleaf species as a silvicultural option for climate-friendly management of the boreal forest.","tags":[],"title":"Stand age and species composition effects on surface albedo in a mixedwood boreal forest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Md Abdul Halim","Sean C Thomas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368142,"objectID":"94fe1148f232b7815e526488e94227af","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/halim-2018-rz/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:01.939266Z","relpermalink":"/publication/halim-2018-rz/","section":"publication","summary":"Scientists unequivocally agree that winter air temperature (TA) in northern high latitudes will increase sharply with anthropogenic climate change, and that such increases are already pervasive. However, contrasting hypotheses and results exist regarding the magnitude and even direction of changes in winter soil temperature (TS). Here we use field and satellite data to examine the 'cold soil in a warm world' hypothesis for the first time in the boreal forest using a proxy year approach. In a proxy warm year with a mean annual temperature similar to that predicted for ~2080, average winter TS was reduced relative to the baseline year by 0.43 to 1.22 °C in open to forested sites. Similarly, average minimum and maximum winter TS declined, and the number of freeze-thaw events increased in the proxy warm year, corresponding to a reduction in the number of snow-covered days relative to the baseline year. Our findings indicate that early soil freezing as a result of delayed snowfall and reduced snow insulation from cold winter air are the main drivers of reduced winter active-layer TS (at ~2-cm depth) under warming conditions in boreal forest, and we also show that these drivers interact strongly with forest stand structure.","tags":[],"title":"A proxy-year analysis shows reduced soil temperatures with climate warming in boreal forest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N Gale","Md A Halim","S C Thomas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368143,"objectID":"fb1929137d427aef75eb4b334c8c3418","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/gale-2017-gk/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:02.892964Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gale-2017-gk/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Biochar and ecosystem restoration: Plant ecophysiological responses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nigel V Gale","Md Abdul Halim","Mark Horsburgh","Sean C Thomas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368142,"objectID":"7819ebd9418e88db899565cc16aee53a","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/gale-2017-hw/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:02.558502Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gale-2017-hw/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Comparative responses of early-successional plants to charcoal soil amendments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M A Halim","S C Thomas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368142,"objectID":"0d8c3f09509773b4592c3c179b6043a8","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/halim-2017-gu/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:02.255499Z","relpermalink":"/publication/halim-2017-gu/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Surface albedo in relation to disturbance and early stand dynamics in the boreal forest: Implications for climate models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Predicting the current and future yields of a stand is essential for successful stand and timber management. Implicit prediction of current yield is accomplished by using diameter distribution methods. All diameter distribution yield systems predict the number of trees per unit area by diameter class. In this study, the normal, lognormal and the three-parameter Weibull probability density function were compared to characterise the diameter distributions of Sal (Shorea robusta) plantations grown at Tilagarh Eco-park, Bangladesh. Data from 70 plots, established in three plantations, were used for this study. The Weibull parameters were estimated by the maximum likelihood and moments estimator methods. A one-sample Kolmogorov Smirnov test was used for the goodness of fit for all models. The Kolmogorov?Smirnov test results showed that both lognormal and Weibull distributions were suitable to characterise the diameter distributions of Sal plantations in the study area and may be applicable for other Sal forests in Bangladesh.","tags":[],"title":"Characterising the diameter distribution of Sal plantations by comparing normal, lognormal and Weibull distributions at Tilagarh Eco-park, Bangladesh","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M A Halim","J Bieser","S C Thomas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1398902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368144,"objectID":"7d9736de0c12887e493a04607e821ae6","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/halim-2014-ko/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:04.15303Z","relpermalink":"/publication/halim-2014-ko/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Inﬂuences of land-use change on radiative forcing in city of Toronto during 2001-2011","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N Gale","M A Halim","S C Thomas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1398902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368144,"objectID":"2989b69a6bad073a127d4a92ed646693","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/gale-2014-wy/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:03.80409Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gale-2014-wy/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Restoring (urban) landscapes with pyrogenic carbon","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M A Halim","S C Thomas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368144,"objectID":"3b1cb7048651065c21ba65ed0b7d1731","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/halim-2014-wm/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:04.457298Z","relpermalink":"/publication/halim-2014-wm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Quantitative tools for modeling coarse woody debris dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiban Chandra Deb","Md Abdul Halim","H M Tuihedur Rahman","Roman Al-Ahmed"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1362096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368145,"objectID":"e6b76a0465815a14aef188b3fd933cb9","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/deb-2013-hz/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:04.74332Z","relpermalink":"/publication/deb-2013-hz/","section":"publication","summary":"Both for environmental and aesthetic purposes, urban street trees have significant importance. In most of the developed cities, this type of plantation is an integral part of landscape planning. Nevertheless, this issue is poorly considered in the cities of developing countries. Consequently, we observe a scarcity of urban street trees. Considering this scenario, we explored the state of urban street tree planting in Sylhet City, which is a growing urban centre in Bangladesh. We assessed the density, diversity, composition and distribution of street trees in the city using different diversity computation indices (e.g. relative abundances, dominance, importance and richness, evenness and diversity) in main and link roads. We also measured the growth pattern of the trees in the study area. It was found that out of 486 studied transects in both main and link roads, 404 had no trees. Sweitenia mahagoni was the dominant species in both road categories. The Mann Whitney U test results suggest that there was no significant difference in tree density and size attributes between the road categories. From these assessments, we concluded that the diversity and distribution of street trees in the study area was very limited. Moreover, there was no scientific arboricultural consideration in species selection to increase street tree planting for the city. We conclude that only proper management and objective-specific endeavor can change the prevailing scenario of the study area.","tags":[],"title":"Density, diversity, composition and distribution of street trees in Sylhet metropolitan city of Bangladesh","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiban Chandra Deb","Md Abdul Halim","Enam Ahmed"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368145,"objectID":"bd36a6f9028e4f0a484df3d82d3f9b09","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/deb-2012-kq/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:05.079022Z","relpermalink":"/publication/deb-2012-kq/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"An allometric equation for estimating stem biomass of textitAcacia auriculiformis in the north-eastern region of Bangladesh","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S K Sarker","J C Deb","M A Halim"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368145,"objectID":"738ec41c1835bf0037ebd03938c82380","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/sarker-2011-ph/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:05.376532Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sarker-2011-ph/","section":"publication","summary":"Imposing logging ban has become widespread in the tropics. Bangladesh government enforced logging bans in 1970s and 1980s to halt deforestation. Such bans have been considered as a strategy to protect and conserve forests although success requires rigorous analysis. In this paper, the performances of the existing logging bans in Bangladesh are examined to assess their effectiveness. Responses of forest management systems, policies, production and governance in attaining the objectives of logging bans are thoroughly addressed and investigated. From this study it is evident that unwise implementations of logging bans have failed to secure forest conservation and production related objectives of the government. Based on the findings, five future directives are advised: (I) continuation of bans in critical natural forests, (II) reinitiating of management practices in the plantations, (III) introducing multipurpose forestry in the protected area co-management systems, (IV) adoption of adaptive community based forest management, and (V) ensure good forest governance.","tags":["\"ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT\"","\"DEFORESTATION\"","\"CO-MANAGEMENT\"","\"SILVICULTURE\"","\"BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION\""],"title":"A diagnosis of existing logging bans in Bangladesh","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M A Halim","J C Deb","S K: Chowdhury, M Sarker"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368146,"objectID":"c863d4fd5170c6c35f36a7fb85ea2067","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/halim-2011-lt/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:05.666761Z","relpermalink":"/publication/halim-2011-lt/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Allometric model for estimating stem biomass of Karach (textitPongamia pinnata) in Ratargul Freshwater Swamp Forest, Bangladesh","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Shaheed Hossain Chowdhury","Mizanur Rahman","Masao Koike","Nur Muhammed","Kazi Mohammad Salahuddin","Md Abdul Halim","Narayan Saha","Parvez Rana","Jahirul Islam"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1267401600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368146,"objectID":"59b3b4d2941c08b628b44d2af0352708","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/chowdhury-2010-yy/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:06.108Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chowdhury-2010-yy/","section":"publication","summary":"Throughout the world ornamentation of body with mehedi (Lawsonia inermis L.) leaf paste, with the trade name `henna body art' is becoming increasingly popular. The worldwide increasing demand of mehedi leaf encourages many countries to adopt commercial farming of the plant. Farmers living in central Bangladesh recently commenced small-scale mehedi farming, primarily with the purpose of meeting national demand. A total of 182 farmers are engaged in mehedi farming and a study was conducted among 36 of them (a 20% random sample) to explore indigenous management techniques, marketing, livelihood potential and constraints of the enterprise. Farming was reported to be the major primary occupation of the study area. An average of 0.05 ha land of the respondents was used for mehedi cultivation, which constituted 16.7% of their average farm land. The farmers applied their own indigenous technology in every aspect of the farming, using branch cuttings as the only propagation material. The financial analysis indicated that mehedi farming is a profitable and attractive option for rural livelihoods [with an estimated net present value of Tk (Bangladeshi currency unit, 1 US $ = 68 Taka (as of May, 2009).) 179,500 for 0.1 ha plantation]. However, the enterprise faces several constraints, including absence of a nursery for supplying planting materials, storage and effective marketing facilities, available capital for investment, improved technology, and above all, government support. If the government extends cooperation by assisting farmers with training, technology, credit and market development, mehedi farming could become an important revenue-earning enterprise in the small-scale cottage sector of Bangladesh.","tags":[],"title":"Small-scale mehedi (textitLawsonia inermis  L.) farming in the central Bangladesh: A promising NTFP-based rural livelihood outside the forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Shaheed Hossain Chowdhury","Masao Koike","Nur Muhammed","Md Abdul Halim","Narayan Saha","Hajime Kobayashi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1238544000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368146,"objectID":"ee91a58ab2bae4d0ce0a7529ffe725c4","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/chowdhury-2009-cf/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:06.466787Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chowdhury-2009-cf/","section":"publication","summary":"This study considered traditional ethno-medicinal practices of rural people of Feni district, Bangladesh, focusing on their utilization of medicinal plants and associated indigenous knowledge.

This exploratory study was conducted to document indigenous knowledge (IK) employed by the Mro tribe in their everyday activities, highlighting traditional utilization of forests and other natural resources. A total of 36 farms were assessed using different participatory appraisals through semi-structured questionnaire. The respondents were peasants who live on the hilltops in a pristine environment, inside the high ranges of hills and dense forest almost totally beyond the eye-sight of the outer civilized society. They developed IK of their own in practising shifting cultivation (Jhum) and other land use systems along with the utilization of natural resources. In most cases, such IK has become key factors in the sound management of their forest resources with sustainable utilization of biodiversity. But most of the wealth of their IK is being threatened by the settlement of the non-tribal people in the CHTs region.

The production cost per seedling ranges from Tk. 4 to 50 while sale value ranges from Tk. 10 to 60. The most frequently sold species are Acacia mangium, Swietenia macrophylla, Tectona grandis, Mangifera indica, Litchi chinensis and Cocos nucifera. Nursery techniques and cultural practices adopted by nursery operators depend on the type of species and its silvicultural requirement.

The sap is either used fresh as drink or after some sort of processing as molasses and/or alcoholic beverage. Seven diversified sites support the palm as its habitat and most palms (20.40%) occur in orchards. Besides growing naturally, the palm is also established in orchards using the wildings as the staple planting material. Although the medium category farmers own most of the palms (33%), a considerable portion (28.68%) of it is managed by the landless farmers, who earn a substantial livelihood from the palms. The farmers practice their own indigenous wisdom in every stage of the palm's maintenance from planting through tapping for sap collection to the processing of products.

Bulk density value of moist and dry surface soil was higher in orange orchard than in forest on both the hill slopes.","tags":[],"title":"Comparative evaluation of physical properties in soils of orange orchard and bushy forest in Chittagong Hill Tracts, Banglandesh","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Shaheed Hossain Chowdhury","Shampa Biswas","Md Abdul Halim","S M Sirajul Haque","Nur Muhammed","Masao Koike"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1172707200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368149,"objectID":"018126496a1c8b1958a98909e5d9268b","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/hossain-chowdhury-2007-tm/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:09.511198Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hossain-chowdhury-2007-tm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Comparative analysis of some selected macronutrients of soil in orange orchard and degraded forests in Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Shaheed Hossain Chowdhury","Md Abdul Halim","Md Danesh Miah","Nur Muhammed","Masao Koike"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1172707200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368150,"objectID":"d94b20bee6753f45f396f68cf79038e0","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/chowdhury-2007-bh/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:09.838Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chowdhury-2007-bh/","section":"publication","summary":"An exploratory study was conducted on the hunting and gathering of wildlife by the Mro tribe in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs) of Bangladesh, highlighting the target animals, preference, frequency and various indigenous techniques of hunting. The farmers are primarily dependent on shifting cultivation and hunting is a secondary occupation, particularly important for poor people. Though the tribe rears some domestic animals for sacrificing on special occasions, game meat appears to be a highly welcomed dietary supplement. A total of 34 species of wildlife were harvested from forests, from insect larvae to elephants. Wild boar ranked first for rich and medium farmers, and monitor lizards were ranked second by all the farmers. The indigenous knowledge about their living patterns and animals has potential for use in commercial animal farming to fulfil the protein demand and improve the socio-economic condition of the Mro.","tags":[],"title":"Research Communication: Biodiversity use through harvesting faunal resources from forests by the Mro tribe in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bangladesh","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M A Halim","M S H Chowdhury","A I Wadud","Md S Uddin","S K Sarker","M B Uddin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607368150,"objectID":"41e80330499ad50517ca3cd593261b54","permalink":"https://mdhalim.com/publication/halim-2007-na/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T19:09:10.241731Z","relpermalink":"/publication/halim-2007-na/","section":"publication","summary":"The Shaiji, a religio-cultural community of southwestern Bangladesh, have an indigenous medication system using locally grown plants. A total of 36 individuals were interviewed using questionnaire. The Shaiji, living in the interior or near bushy habitats for the sake of meditation and other spiritual activities, were found to be totally dependent on herbal medicines for treating ailments ranging from casual cold to diabetes. As this indigenous knowledge is handed down orally from generation to generation, there is a great possibility that the knowledge will be lost over time. A total of 47 plant species were used by the Shaiji for medicinal purposes. They mainly used leaves, either taken orally or used externally. They used the plant species in a sustainable manner and also cultivated some. Thus, they play an important role in biodiversity conservation.","tags":[],"title":"The use of plants in traditional health care practice of the ``Shaiji'' community in southwestern Bangladesh","type":"publication"}]
