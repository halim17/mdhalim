 abstract = {The state of urban seedling nurseries in the north-eastern region
of Bangladesh is examined with a focus on production and
profitability of the enterprises. Twenty-eight sample nurseries
out of the 97 nursery enterprises in Sylhet town were selected at
random, and operators personally interviewed. It was found that
the entrepreneurs are not highly educated though they believed
that a basic level of education is required to understand the
management of young nursery stock. Labourers of various
employment categories work in the enterprises and their wage is
determined by their skill, gender and efficiency. Capital and
operating costs vary among the enterprises according to land
value, production capacity, infrastructure type and workforce
size. Production capacity ranges from 10,000 to 5 M
seedlings/year with an average 836,000, though actual average
production is only 341,000 seedlings/year. The production cost
per seedling ranges from Tk. 4 to 50 while sale value ranges from
Tk. 10 to 60. The most frequently sold species are Acacia
mangium, Swietenia macrophylla, Tectona grandis, Mangifera
indica, Litchi chinensis and Cocos nucifera. Nursery techniques
and cultural practices adopted by nursery operators depend on the
type of species and its silvicultural requirement. Despite some
problems, including lack of suitable land for nursery
establishment and inadequate level of technical knowledge for
high quality seedling management, it seems that production of
tree seedlings is a promising profitable small-scale business in
the study area.},
