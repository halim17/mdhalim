 abstract = {An exploratory study was conducted on the hunting and gathering
of wildlife by the Mro tribe in the Chittagong Hill Tracts
(CHTs) of Bangladesh, highlighting the target animals,
preference, frequency and various indigenous techniques of
hunting. The farmers are primarily dependent on shifting
cultivation and hunting is a secondary occupation, particularly
important for poor people. Though the tribe rears some domestic
animals for sacrificing on special occasions, game meat appears
to be a highly welcomed dietary supplement. A total of 34
species of wildlife were harvested from forests, from insect
larvae to elephants. Wild boar ranked first for rich and medium
farmers, and monitor lizards were ranked second by all the
farmers. The indigenous knowledge about their living patterns
and animals has potential for use in commercial animal farming
to fulfil the protein demand and improve the socio-economic
condition of the Mro.},
