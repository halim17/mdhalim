 abstract = {The physical properties of soil on two hill slopes of 35% and
55% in orange orchard cultivated by the Mro tribe of Chittagong
Hill Tracts (CHTs) were evaluated and compared with those of
bushy hill forests. Soil samples were collected from three
different depths (0--5 cm, 5--15 cm and 15--30 cm), digging three
profiles in each land use for determining moisture content,
organic matter content and particle density. Maximum water
holding capacity, field capacity, dry and moist bulk density and
porosity were determined only for the surface soils. Moisture
content at all the soil depths was significantly higher (p $Å‚eq$
0.05) in orange orchard than in forest on both the slopes. Orange
orchard contained lower mean soil organic matter than forest on
55% slope, while it contained higher values on 35% slope
compared to forest. The highest value of the above two properties
was found at surface soil in both the land uses on both the
slopes, decreasing with the increase of soil depth. On both the
slopes maximum water holding capacity and porosity of surface
soil and particle density at all soil depths were lower in orange
orchard compared to those in forest. Field capacity values of
surface soil did not show consistency in trend for the
differences between the two land uses on both the slopes. Bulk
density value of moist and dry surface soil was higher in orange
orchard than in forest on both the hill slopes.},
