 abstract = {A study was conducted to explore the traditional utilization
pattern and indigenous management practices of wild date palm
(Phoenix sylvestris Roxb) in the rural agrarian regions of
Bangladesh. A multistage sampling method with 10% intensity and
a semi-structured questionnaire were used for the study. The
farmers manage the palm mainly for sap production with which
sugar based secondary goods are manufactured. The sap is either
used fresh as drink or after some sort of processing as molasses
and/or alcoholic beverage. Seven diversified sites support the
palm as its habitat and most palms (20.40%) occur in orchards.
Besides growing naturally, the palm is also established in
orchards using the wildings as the staple planting material.
Although the medium category farmers own most of the palms
(33%), a considerable portion (28.68%) of it is managed by the
landless farmers, who earn a substantial livelihood from the
palms. The farmers practice their own indigenous wisdom in every
stage of the palm's maintenance from planting through tapping for
sap collection to the processing of products. If managed more
scientifically on a sustainable basis with the collaboration of
farmers' indigenous knowledge, this familiar palm could be able
to support the rural economy of the country to a great extent.
Side by side, it would also be able to contribute to the richness
of biodiversity in the region.},
