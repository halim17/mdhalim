 abstract = {The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs) region of Bangladesh, covering
a considerable portion of hill forest type of the country, is
rich in biological diversity; in terms of flora, fauna and
ethnicity. A number of aboriginal and tribal communities enrich
the cultural heritage of the region. Thanchi upazilla
(sub-district) of Bandarban district in the CHTs is the remotest
forested area where some tribal groups still lead their
subsistence life depending fully on natural resources. This
exploratory study was conducted to document indigenous knowledge
(IK) employed by the Mro tribe in their everyday activities,
highlighting traditional utilization of forests and other
natural resources. A total of 36 farms were assessed using
different participatory appraisals through semi-structured
questionnaire. The respondents were peasants who live on the
hilltops in a pristine environment, inside the high ranges of
hills and dense forest almost totally beyond the eye-sight of
the outer civilized society. They developed IK of their own in
practising shifting cultivation (Jhum) and other land use
systems along with the utilization of natural resources. In most
cases, such IK has become key factors in the sound management of
their forest resources with sustainable utilization of
biodiversity. But most of the wealth of their IK is being
threatened by the settlement of the non-tribal people in the
CHTs region. The life style and ethno-forestry perception
regulated by IK governing the daily activities of the ethnic
communities need to be explored in order to conserve them and to
assess the possibilities for conserving the forest resources by
utilizing such traditional indigenous concepts.},
