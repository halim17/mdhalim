 abstract = {Throughout the world ornamentation of body with mehedi (Lawsonia
inermis L.) leaf paste, with the trade name `henna body art' is
becoming increasingly popular. The worldwide increasing demand of
mehedi leaf encourages many countries to adopt commercial farming
of the plant. Farmers living in central Bangladesh recently
commenced small-scale mehedi farming, primarily with the purpose
of meeting national demand. A total of 182 farmers are engaged in
mehedi farming and a study was conducted among 36 of them (a 20%
random sample) to explore indigenous management techniques,
marketing, livelihood potential and constraints of the
enterprise. Farming was reported to be the major primary
occupation of the study area. An average of 0.05 ha land of the
respondents was used for mehedi cultivation, which constituted
16.7% of their average farm land. The farmers applied their own
indigenous technology in every aspect of the farming, using
branch cuttings as the only propagation material. The financial
analysis indicated that mehedi farming is a profitable and
attractive option for rural livelihoods [with an estimated net
present value of Tk (Bangladeshi currency unit, 1 US \$ = 68 Taka
(as of May, 2009).) 179,500 for 0.1 ha plantation]. However, the
enterprise faces several constraints, including absence of a
nursery for supplying planting materials, storage and effective
marketing facilities, available capital for investment, improved
technology, and above all, government support. If the government
extends cooperation by assisting farmers with training,
technology, credit and market development, mehedi farming could
become an important revenue-earning enterprise in the small-scale
cottage sector of Bangladesh.},
