 abstract = {An exploratory study was conducted in Chuadanga, a southwestern
district of Bangladesh to explore the status and potential of
Khejur palm (Phoenix sylvestris Roxb.) husbandry in the rural
economy. A total of 36 households in three villages of the
district were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire.
The farmers were categorized into five groups as landless,
marginal, small, medium and large on the basis of their land
holdings. The palm was distributed over seven different
geographical sites of which orchards supported the most (20%).
The farmers of medium category owned the most palms (33%) and
the landless the fewest (4%), but most of the palms (29%) were
managed by the landless category. Palms 7?14 years old growing
in the agricultural fields and ails produced most sap (2500ml,
on average each night). The large category farmers realized the
highest average seasonal income from the palm products (Taka1
38,135.00), but the relative contribution to income from palm
products was the highest (78%) among the landless farmers.
Khejur palm husbandry could be a promising source of rural
incomes in Bangladesh if the farmers' indigenous technology was
linked to more scientific management practices.},
