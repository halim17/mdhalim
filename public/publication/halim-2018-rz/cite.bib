 abstract = {Scientists unequivocally agree that winter air temperature (TA)
in northern high latitudes will increase sharply with
anthropogenic climate change, and that such increases are already
pervasive. However, contrasting hypotheses and results exist
regarding the magnitude and even direction of changes in winter
soil temperature (TS). Here we use field and satellite data to
examine the 'cold soil in a warm world' hypothesis for the first
time in the boreal forest using a proxy year approach. In a proxy
warm year with a mean annual temperature similar to that
predicted for ~2080, average winter TS was reduced relative to
the baseline year by 0.43 to 1.22 Â°C in open to forested sites.
Similarly, average minimum and maximum winter TS declined, and
the number of freeze-thaw events increased in the proxy warm
year, corresponding to a reduction in the number of snow-covered
days relative to the baseline year. Our findings indicate that
early soil freezing as a result of delayed snowfall and reduced
snow insulation from cold winter air are the main drivers of
reduced winter active-layer TS (at ~2-cm depth) under warming
conditions in boreal forest, and we also show that these drivers
interact strongly with forest stand structure.},
