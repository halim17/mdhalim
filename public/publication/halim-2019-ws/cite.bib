 abstract = {Surface albedo is one of the most important processes governing
climate forcing in the boreal forest and is directly affected by
management activities such as harvesting and natural disturbances
such as forest fires. Empirical data on the effects of these
disturbances on boreal forest albedo are sparse. We conducted
ground-based measurements of surface albedo from a series of
instrument towers over 4 years in a replicated chronosequence of
mixed-wood boreal forest sites differing in stand age (0 to 19
years since disturbance) in both post-harvest and post-fire
stands. We investigated the effects of stand age, canopy height,
tree species composition, and ground vegetation cover on surface
albedo through stand development. Our results indicate that
winter and spring albedo values were 63 % and 24 % higher,
respectively, in post-harvest stands than in post-fire
stands.Summer and fall albedo values were similar between
disturbance types, with summer albedo showing a transient peak
atâˆ¼10 years stand age. The proportion of deciduous broadleaf
species showed a strong positive relationship with seasonal
averages of albedo in both post-harvest and post-fire
stands.Given that stand composition in mixedwood boreal forests
generally shows a gradual replacement of deciduous trees by
conifers, our results suggest that successional changes in
species composition are likely a key driver of age-related
patterns in albedo. Our findings also suggest the efficacy of
increasing the proportion of deciduous broadleaf species as a
silvicultural option for climate-friendly management of the
boreal forest.},
