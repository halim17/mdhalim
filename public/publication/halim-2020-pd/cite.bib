 abstract = {Green roofs are an emerging approach to enhance climate
resilience of urban areas, including mitigation of stormwater
discharge and urban heat island effects. There has also been
recent interest in green roofs to enhance carbon
sequestration, but direct measurements of greenhouse gas
fluxes from established green roof systems are lacking. To
better understand the relationships between green roof
vegetation and substrate with greenhouse gas fluxes, we
measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes, using a dynamic closed chamber
technique, from substrates of experimental green roof units
in Toronto in the early, mid, and late growing seasons of
2018. This measurements included extensive systems with mixes
of Sedum species and intensive systems using a native meadow
species mix, with both vegetation types implemented in a
factorial design with substrate depth and type (high vs. low
organic matter content) as factors. We hypothesized that CO2
fluxes would be higher in high organic matter substrates, and
that systems with low vegetation cover and high organic
matter would act as CH4 sources. Substrate CO2 efflux varied
from 0.1--0.51 Âµmol.m-2.s-1, with pronounced differences in
flux rates related to substrate type and depth (higher with
increased substrate depth) but had little effect of
vegetation type. Substrate CH4 fuxes included both net efflux
and uptake (-0.1 to 0.14 nmol.m-2.s-1). Net uptake was found
to be associated with high vegetation cover, particularly of
native species. Results suggest that high organic matter in
green roof substrates, while enhancing plant growth, can
result in appreciable C losses, partly as CH4. Studies have
explored various green roof substrates to enhance carbon
sequestration of green roofs. Biochar, usually derived from
pyrolyzed waste biomass, can be a potential amendment to
green roof substrates to mitigate C loss. Recalcitrant
biochars can increase soil water holding capacity and plant
growth, and also known to suppress soil greenhouse gas fluxes
in managed systems. However, the biochar effects on
greenhouse fluxes of greenroof substrates have not previously
been evaluated. In a similar experimental setup as above, we
examined the effects of biochar addition (20 t/ha, sugar
maple biochar) to a high organic matter green roof substrate
in Sedum beds. Initial results indicate that biochar addition
does not affect substrate CO2 effluxes, but can significantly
reduce carbon loss from green roofs, mainly by suppressing
(200%) CH4 effluuxes. Overall, our studies suggest that
biochar can be a sustainable amendment to green roof
substrates to mitigate C loss.},
