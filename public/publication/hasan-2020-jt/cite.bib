 abstract = {One of humanity's most significant challenges in the process of
attaining the established sustainability goals is balancing the
growing human demand for food and the need to conserve
biodiversity. This challenge requires appropriate land uses that
are able to conserve biodiversity while ensuring ample food
supply. This study compares bird species diversity and abundance
in areas undergoing land sharing and land sparing in
northeastern Bangladesh (West Bhanugach Reserved Forest). Birds
serve as useful biologic indicators because of their presence
within different trophic levels and their well-studied ecology.
To survey birds, we selected a total of 66 sampling sites within
land-sharing (33) and land-sparing (33) land-use areas. Between
May and June 2017, we observed and recorded bird calls within a
50-m radius around each sampling site. We counted 541
individuals from 46 species of birds. The Shannon bird diversity
was higher in the land-sparing sites (1.52) than in the
land-sharing sites (1.23). We found approximately 30% more bird
species (39 vs. 30) and 40% more individuals (318 vs. 223) in
the land-sparing areas than land-sharing areas. Three bird
species, Arachnothera longirostra, Micropternus brachyurus and
Copsychus malabaricus, were significantly associated with the
land-sparing sites. This study shows that land sharing
negatively affects bird diversity, richness and abundance
compared to land-sparing. The use of chemical fertilizers and
the lack of food, such as insects, for birds can explain the
lower diversity, richness and abundance of birds in the
land-sharing areas. Although land sharing is an effective means
of producing food, land sparing is the most effective land-use
practice for preserving bird diversity in northeastern
Bangladesh.},
