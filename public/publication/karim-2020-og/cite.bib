 abstract = {A body of emerging research shows the promise of charcoal soil
amendments (``biochars'') in restoring fertility in degraded
agricultural and forest soils. ``Sustainable biochars'' derived
from locally produced waste biomass and produced near the
application site are of particular interest. We tested the
effects of surface applications of wood-derived biochars
(applied at 7.5 t·ha−1) on soil physiochemical properties (N, P,
K, pH, soil moisture content, organic matter content, and bulk
density) in three land-use types: agriculture (Camellia sinensis
monoculture), agroforestry (C. sinensis with shade trees), and
secondary forest (Dipterocarpus dominated) assessed over seven
months. We found significant positive effects of biochar on soil
physiochemical properties in all land-use types, with the
strongest responses in the most degraded tea monoculture sites.
Although biochar had no significant effect on soil N and K, it
improved soil P---the primary nutrient most commonly limiting in
tropical soils. Biochar also enhanced soil moisture and organic
matter content, reduced bulk density, and increased soil pH in
monoculture sites. Our results support the general hypothesis
that biochar can improve the fertility of degraded soils in
agricultural and forest systems in Bangladesh and suggest that
biochar additions may be of great benefit to the most degraded
soils.},
