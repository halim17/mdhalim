 abstract = {Forests cover about thirty percent of the Earth's land surface
and are important in providing critical ecosystem services,
including carbon sequestration, storage, and cycling. Forests
sequester and store more carbon than any other terrestrial
ecosystem on Earth. In forests, plants take up carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere and release oxygen during photosynthesis,
which transfers carbon to their stems, roots, and leaves as they
grow. Forests store carbon in five major pools, these are: i)
aboveground biomass, ii) belowground biomass, iii) litter, iv)
deadwood and v) soil. Forests are also a major source of global
anthropogenic carbon emissions, the second largest after fossil
fuel. Protecting forests from deforestation and degradation and
expansion of forest in new areas is, therefore, considered as
amongst the most cost-effective strategy for climate change
mitigation. Here, we provide a synthesis of current knowledge
regarding forest carbon stock and fluxes, their distribution
across different biomes, biogeochemical cycles, their
measurement and drivers of change in global forest carbon stock
and fluxes. Finally, we provide recommendations on strategies
for improving forest carbon stocks to achieve sustainable
development goals, biodiversity conservation, and future climate
stabilization.},
